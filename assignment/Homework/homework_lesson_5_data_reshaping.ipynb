    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on mastering data reshaping techniques using R's tidyverse ecosystem, specifically the `tidyr` package. You'll work with real-world business datasets to practice converting between wide and long formats, understanding when each format is most appropriate for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Master `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions for data reshaping\n",
    "- Understand the principles of tidy data and their business applications\n",
    "- Apply appropriate data structures for different analytical purposes\n",
    "- Validate data integrity during transformation processes\n",
    "- Prepare data for visualization and statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Context\n",
    "Data reshaping is a fundamental skill in business analytics. Different analytical tasks, visualization requirements, and stakeholder needs often require data in specific formats. This assignment will help you develop the strategic thinking needed to choose and implement appropriate data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Requirements:**\n",
    "- Complete all tasks in this R notebook\n",
    "- Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) and chain operations wherever possible\n",
    "- Ensure your code is well-commented and demonstrates understanding\n",
    "- Include business interpretations of your results\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n",
    "- Correct implementation of reshaping functions\n",
    "- Appropriate choice of data formats for different tasks\n",
    "- Quality of code comments and explanations\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question 1: Strategic Format Selection** 🎯\n",
    "*Describe a specific business scenario from your current or future workplace where you would need to convert data from wide to long format. Explain your reasoning for choosing long format and what type of analysis this would enable. Include details about the stakeholders involved and how the format choice would impact their ability to understand and use the results.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Question 2: Validation and Data Integrity** 🔍\n",
    "*During this homework, we implemented several validation checks after each reshaping operation. Reflect on why data validation is crucial in business analytics and describe what could happen if validation steps were skipped. Provide a specific example of a business decision that could be negatively impacted by unvalidated data transformations.*\n",
